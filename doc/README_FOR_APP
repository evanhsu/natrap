DEPLOYMENT TO DREAMHOST
 -On the development machine, run:
 
 	bundle package
 	
 -Upload files to the production server
 -Ensure server has the 'bundler' gem installed in the correct folder, run:
 	
 	gem unpack bundler --target=vendor/bundle
 
 -Install the gems required by your app by running:
 
 	bundle install --deployment

-Troubleshooting
 You may receive an error that the mysql adapter is missing. Running a 'Bundle show'
 may confirm that your bundle is missing the mysql gem, even though it's
 listed in the Gemfile.  Look in the Gemfile.lock for a line that specifies
 which version of the mysql gem to use.  It may look like this:

 mysql (2.8.1-x86-mingw32)

 That line specifies that you want the Windows version of the mysql gem, because
 'bundle install' was run on a Windows machine which generated the Gemfile.lock
 file.
 When you deploy to a non-Windows production machine, leave your Gemfile.lock
 file off the production machine. Once all your files are in place, run
 'bundle update' to create a new Gemfile.lock file.
